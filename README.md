# Machine Learning Regression Models

## Training ML Regressors to:
- learn the relationship of different datasets and 
- evaluating how well they have come to learn the data

## List of Datasets the Models trained on:
- 50_Startups.csv
- Position_Salaries.csv
- Salary_Data.csv

## Note that Data preprocessing has been taken into consideration before training or Models and finally evaluating them.

- You could find how to work on the preprocessing (i.e cleaning up missing data, address categorical data, split data and applying feature scaling) in the Data-Preprocessing repository.
